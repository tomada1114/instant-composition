# Cost discipline

What this skill keeps out of the main context, why the run count is what it is, and why
each spawn gets the model it gets. Read it when deciding whether to delegate a step,
before changing a run count, or before picking a `/code-review` effort.

The main context holds the selection and the verdicts, nothing else. Issue bodies go to
the triage agent, diffs stay in the sub-agent run that produced them, CI logs and verify
output reach the parent through a file rather than through the prompt. If you find
yourself about to read a full GitHub API JSON blob, a workflow log, or an unrelated part
of a diff in the main context, that is the signal to delegate or scope the read instead.

Labeling is the cheap half of this by design: the backfill is a pure script pass with a
one-line summary, and re-deriving priority from issue prose happens once per issue —
ever — because the answer is written back to GitHub. On a labeled backlog the whole
ranking step is `--select`, three lines, no spawn at all. Never re-read bodies to
reconstruct a priority a label already carries; if a label looks wrong, fix the label.

## Code review effort

Only for [step 4](../SKILL.md#4-review-the-branch)'s local pass.

`/code-review <effort> <branch> --fix` forks and runs entirely outside this session's
context — the finders' reads never reach here, only the findings do. Effort controls how
much of that runs:

**`medium` is this repository's standing effort, for every branch.** The owner chose it
over `low`: the implementation is usually an `executor` run at low effort, and a
one-pass review on top of a low-effort implementation leaves nobody reading the change
with any depth.

| effort   | pipeline                                                                      | when                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `medium` | 8 finder angles × 6 candidates, 1-vote verify, ≤8 findings (precision-biased) | **the default, every branch**                                                                                                                                              |
| `high`   | same 8 angles, 1-vote verify biased toward recall, ≤10 findings               | the change can lose or corrode data that already exists — a migration, a storage-layer write, a released public contract real consumers are on — or the user asked for one |

Never `low`: it is one pass with no verify sub-pass, and it **skips test and fixture
hunks**, so a diff confined to a file under `tests/` that _is_ a gate — one that lints
workflow YAML, asserts boundaries, or walks the tree for secrets — comes back `(none)`
having read nothing. Observed: a gate change reviewed at `low` returned no findings;
re-run at `medium` it returned four, one of them a security rule that silently accepted
three of the four YAML spellings it existed to reject. Never `ultra` either: it runs in
the cloud, is billed per use, and the prompt that defines it says a model cannot launch
it itself.

Diff size or file count alone is not a reason to go to `high`. A run that did escalate
says so in the step 10 report, with the reason.

## What the startup costs

Steps 0 through 2c are one `plan.py` call and one `gh` fetch pair — preflight, ranking,
selection, repo profile and grouping in a single block. Two things keep it there, and
both are easy to undo by accident:

- **The digest cache.** Every `issue_digest.py` call inside the same few minutes reads
  the fetch the plan already paid for; `--issue`, `--detail` and `--body-chars` all
  filter data already in hand rather than re-fetching it. What breaks this is asking the
  same question in three calls — a `--select`, then a `--rank-only`, then a list of
  `--issue` numbers — which is what `--with-rank` and `--detail-top` exist to collapse.
  Pass `--refresh` only after this run changed the backlog; passing it habitually turns
  the cache off.
- **The reference files.** `dependency-triage.md` and `worktree-parallelism.md` are ~380
  lines between them and are _not_ hot-path reading any more. The plan answers what they
  used to be read for; open them when it says `PARTIAL`, when a gate fails, or before
  cleanup — not on every run.

The one thing worth spending on at startup is `issue_digest.py --detail-top K` when the
picked issues' bodies genuinely have to be read. That is still one call, and it is
bounded by K.

## Run budget

Run count scales with issue count, not with thoroughness: one triage spawn (optional),
one implementation sub-agent per issue plus up to 2 patch rounds — sent to that same
agent, not to a fresh spawn — when this session's judgment finds the first incomplete,
one `/code-review` per branch, in parallel mode one fix sub-agent per branch that had
accepted findings (none when a review came back clean), up to 3 CI repair attempts per
PR, on at most two agents (an `executor` continued, then a fresh `architect`). This
session's own judgment calls — reading the implementation diff, reading `--fix`'s diff,
deciding what CI failure means — cost targeted reads in this context, never a spawn.
Filing a follow-up (step 8) never adds a run either: whatever found it already returned
the lead under `FOLLOW-UPS`, and confirming it costs a couple of targeted reads.

Two things scale that count beyond the issue list itself, both deliberately bounded:

- **Background design agents (step 8b)** — one `architect` run per design-blocked issue,
  capped at 3 in flight. They cost nothing in wall-clock on the shipping path (nothing
  ever waits on one) and almost nothing in this context: what comes back is a verdict
  and a two-line approach, while the design itself goes to the issue. What they buy is a
  backlog that stops accumulating undecided work — the single most expensive thing a
  backlog can hold, because every future ranking pass re-reads it and skips it again.
- **Shipping the run's own follow-ups (step 8c)** — a full steps 3–8 cycle per
  follow-up, the same cost as any issue. This is why depth is capped at 1: a run that
  shipped what it filed, and then what _that_ filed, has no termination condition and no
  budget the user agreed to. Depth 1, then stop and report.

## Model and effort assignment

<!-- derived from orchestrating-models §2 -->

Every sub-agent runs on Opus 5.5; the tier is the effort, and there are exactly two,
defined in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent       | Effort | Takes                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `executor`  | low    | settled spec, clear pass/fail, mechanical work, judgment-free research |
| `architect` | high   | design judgment, review and bug-finding, a foundation, unresolved spec |

Spawn one by `subagent_type`, never by a bare `model`: a bare model inherits this
session's effort (medium), which is neither tier. A runtime without these named agents
runs the step at the nearest effort it can set, or inline in this session.

Implementation and priority research go to `executor` — fully specified work with a
clear pass/fail — with one standing exception below. CI repair starts on `executor` and
escalates to `architect` once the same failure survives two attempts in a row —
persistent failure is a sign the spec (or the fix) needs more judgment, not more
mechanical retries. The `/code-review` fallback runs on `architect`, since review and
bug-finding is work with genuinely unresolved spec. Design decisions (step 8b) run on
`architect` for the same reason and more so — deciding an approach nobody has decided is
the least mechanical work this skill delegates, and a bad decision recorded on an issue
outlives the run that made it. It is also the only sub-agent here that writes to GitHub
(one comment, one label) and the only one that writes no code at all.

### Where the cost of a spawn actually goes

A sub-agent shares no prompt cache with this session: it starts cold and pays for its
system prompt, tool definitions, the project's instruction files and its brief at the
cache-_write_ price, once per spawn. Inside its own run the later turns read that back
at the cache-read price, so the fixed cost is per spawn, not per turn — small next to
the implementation it buys. What does add up is **spawning again for the same issue**:
every fresh agent re-learns the diff and re-explores the code a previous one already
read. So a patch round, a second CI repair attempt on the same tier, and any follow-up
question go to **the same agent, continued** (`SendMessage` in Claude Code), which keeps
its context and its warm cache. Spawn fresh only when the tier changes (the CI repair
escalation to `architect`) or the agent cannot be continued.

### The foundation exception: `architect` for what the backlog builds on

Some issues are not "fully specified work with a clear pass/fail" even when their body
is excellent, because what they produce is a **shape other issues copy** rather than a
behavior a test pins down. Spawn the step 3 implementation on **`architect`** when the
issue is any of:

- **Architecture or a skeleton** — the directory layout, the app/router skeleton, the
  composition root, a zone or module boundary.
- **An interface, port, or schema** — a public contract, an adapter boundary, an error
  taxonomy, a data shape. The first implementer fixes the vocabulary every later one
  inherits.
- **A skill, instruction file, or gate design** — a `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, a lint rule that encodes a convention, a CI job that defines what "green"
  means. These are prompts and policies: they are read by every future run, and a
  mediocre one degrades work long after this run ends.

The test is not difficulty, it is **blast radius**: would a wrong call here be cheap to
correct in its own follow-up, or would it be copied by every issue after it? Only the
second earns `architect`.

Signals visible before spawning, straight off `issue_digest.py`: an `unblocks×N` of 2 or
more, a `foundation`/`schema`/`interface` signal, or a Done-means written as a structure
to establish rather than a behavior to observe. Any one of those is a reason to look;
the blast-radius test decides.

Everything else stays on `executor`, which is most of a backlog: bug fixes, removals,
mechanical rewrites, config edits, documentation that follows a shape already settled,
and any issue whose Done-means is a command that passes. A removal-only issue is
`executor` even when it is `P0` and unblocks the whole chain — deleting what a decision
already condemned carries no design in it.

A patch round stays on the tier its first run used, because a foundation the first run
got half-right is exactly where the remaining judgment sits.

Implementation stays delegated even though this session runs the same model — a
deliberate exception to the "do it yourself" default, bought for context isolation: the
diff and the repo exploration are never needed in the main context again once this
session has judged the result.

### The floor: too small to delegate

That exception buys context isolation, and an issue with almost no context to isolate
does not repay it. Below a certain size the handoff costs more than the work: writing a
self-contained prompt, waiting, reading the report, then re-deriving enough of the diff
to judge it — for a change this session could have made and verified in a couple of
commands.

Implement it directly when **all** of these hold:

- the whole change is a handful of lines in one or two files, and this session already
  knows which lines from the issue body or a finding it just read;
- there is no exploration to do — nothing to search for, no unfamiliar module to learn;
- the verification is a command whose output this session reads anyway (`pnpm audit`,
  one test file, the gate);
- it is not foundational by the test above. A three-line change to an interface or a
  gate is still foundational — size is not the same question as blast radius, and this
  floor never overrides that section.

A dependency pin closing a named advisory, a one-line config fix a review turned up, a
stale reference in an instruction file: these are the shape. Say in the step 10 report
that the run implemented it directly, so the choice is visible rather than looking like
a skipped step.

Everything above that floor — anything with a file to find, a module to read, or a test
to design — stays delegated, whatever the main model is.

## What parallel mode costs

Parallel mode does not reduce the number of runs — the same issues need the same
implementations. What it changes is when they happen, and what has to be set up first.

**Added, per issue in a parallel batch:** one dependency install and one baseline verify
(`worktree_setup.sh`), both outside this context — the parent reads one `verdict:` line
each. Plus, per branch with accepted review findings, one `executor` fix run that serial
mode gets for free from `/code-review --fix`.

**Saved:** the implementations overlap instead of queueing, which is the longest stretch
of a run, and nothing in this context grows to pay for it — each sub-agent's exploration
and diff still stay inside its own run.

The break-even is group size. One issue in a group means paying the setup for no overlap
at all, which is why the plan refuses to parallelize a group smaller than 2. The default
cap of 3 comes from somewhere else entirely — rebase churn as the default branch moves
under the batch — not from cost, which is why `plan.py --max-parallel` can raise it when
the user asks for more and why nothing else should. Every issue past 3 in a batch is
another branch that has to be brought forward after each merge in the batch, and that
churn grows with the square of the group, not with it.

A repo that fails the viability gate costs one worktree's setup to discover, once per
run. The answer is a property of the repository, not of any issue: never re-test it per
issue.
