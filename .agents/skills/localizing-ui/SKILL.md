  Covers the message catalogs under messages/ and the locale plumbing in src/i18n/:
  adding or renaming a UI string so the catalogs, MESSAGE_KEYS and the typed key union
  stay in step, ICU arguments and plural categories, and linking with Link from
  src/i18n/navigation.ts rather than next/link. Use when adding a translated string,
  editing messages/ja.json, touching src/i18n/locales.ts, messages.ts, routing.ts,
  request.ts or navigation.ts, adding a locale, or when a message renders as its own key
  name.

# Localizing UI

**Owns:** what goes into a message catalog and how a locale reaches the code that
renders it — `messages/*.json`, the typed key union in `src/i18n/messages.ts`, and the
locale-aware modules under `src/i18n/`. **Does not own:** the shape of a page, layout,
Route Handler or `src/proxy.ts` (`building-app-routes`); how a rendered test case is
written (`writing-tests`) and which vitest project it joins (`placing-tests`);
TypeScript idiom inside a module (`writing-typescript`); dropping a locale when turning
this template into an app (`starting-an-app`).

## A tree full of Japanese is not a violation

AGENTS.md's Conventions makes `messages/*.json` the one exception to the English-only
rule, and states the exception's own limit: it covers the catalogs' string values and
nothing else. Keys stay English, and so does every comment, test, and document about
them, bar the narrow case AGENTS.md spells out — a literal whose exact bytes are what a
check or a worked example exercises, which is why the `localeCount` example below quotes
`ja.json` rather than translating it. That rule lives in AGENTS.md; this skill only
points at it.

The place it is easiest to break is a skill's own frontmatter. Enforced by:
`tests/skills-frontmatter.test.ts`, which rejects CJK in a `description`. A Japanese
example belongs in a fenced block in a body, never in a trigger string.

`typos.toml` scans `messages/` with no exclusion and needs none — Japanese text does not
look like a misspelled English word. If the spell-checker ever fires on a catalog, fix
the text; adding an exclusion is weakening a gate.

## Adding a string, end to end

Three edits, in this order. Doing two of them and running a check reports the part you
have not made yet, so make all three first.

1. `messages/ja.json` — add the key under a namespace. Japanese, the one locale this app
   ships, is the source of truth for the catalog's _shape_: `Messages = typeof ja`. A
   locale added later must hold the same key; omitting it is a type error rather than a
   blank string in production, because `MESSAGES` is annotated
   `Readonly<Record<Locale, Messages>>`.
2. `tests/messages.test.ts` — add the dotted `Namespace.key` to `MESSAGE_KEYS`. It lives
   in the test, not in `src/`, because nothing the application ships reads it: it exists
   only to be diffed against the catalog (see the three checks below).
3. Render it: `const t = useTranslations("Namespace")`, then `t("key")`.

Then `pnpm exec vitest run tests/messages.test.ts && pnpm typecheck`.

Three checks hold the catalog, the hand-written list and the typed union together. The
last two overlap on purpose: both fail when `ja.json` gains a key nobody listed, but
only the runtime case names it.

- `MESSAGE_KEYS` is `as const satisfies readonly MessageKey[]`, so an entry the catalog
  does not hold — a typo, a key renamed or deleted in `ja.json` — fails
  `pnpm typecheck`.
- `expectTypeOf<(typeof MESSAGE_KEYS)[number]>().toEqualTypeOf<MessageKey>()` fails
  `pnpm typecheck` when `ja.json` gained a key nobody listed, but the error names a type
  mismatch, not the key. `as const satisfies` rather than an annotation of
  `readonly MessageKey[]` is what makes this possible: the annotation would discard the
  literal tuple type and let a new key land silently.
- The runtime case fires on that same omission, comparing the list against the keys read
  from `messages/ja.json` on disk rather than from what the bundler resolved — keep it
  for that: it is the one check that names the offending key, and the only one that
  would notice `DottedKeys` and the test's own `dottedKeys` walk disagreeing, a
  divergence that would make both type checks agree wrongly.

`MESSAGE_KEYS` is the one thing here that is not derived from `ja.json`, and that is
deliberate. `MessageKey` agrees with the catalog by construction, so it can never report
a key that was never added; only a list a human maintains as step 2 above can. Deriving
it would collapse all three checks into `flatten(ja) === flatten(ja)`.

A namespace is a first-level object in the catalog and the argument `useTranslations`
takes. Group by the component that reads it — the `LocaleSwitcher` namespace holds one
entry per locale code, which is what lets `switcher(locale)` name a language without a
lookup table of its own.

## ICU arguments and plural categories

- An argument is `{name}`, and every locale's version of a key must ask for the same
  set. Enforced by: `tests/messages.test.ts`, which compares argument names per key
  across catalogs — an argument the caller does not pass is a runtime formatting error
  in that one locale, on a page nobody opened in it.
- Plural **categories** deliberately differ between catalogs, and the test does not
  compare them. `HomePage.localeCount` carries only `other` in `ja.json`, because
  Japanese has no singular/plural distinction; an English catalog added later would
  carry `one` and `other`, and an unused `one` branch in Japanese would be a translation
  of a grammar the language does not have.

  ```json
  "localeCount": "{count, plural, other {このテンプレートには # 言語が含まれています。}}"
  ```

- `#` inside a plural branch is the count. Pass it as an argument —
  `t("localeCount", { count: LOCALES.length })` — and never format a number into the
  string yourself, which would hard-code one locale's digit grouping into all of them.

## The modules, and which one to reach for

Each file under `src/i18n/` carries its reasoning in its own TSDoc; read the file rather
than a paraphrase. What is worth knowing before you open one:

- `locales.ts` — `LOCALES`, `Locale`, `DEFAULT_LOCALE`. It imports nothing on purpose,
  so a module that only has to name a locale does not pull `next-intl` in behind it.
  Import the list from here, not from `routing.ts`.
- `messages.ts` — the catalogs, `MessageKey`, and the `declare module "next-intl"` block
  that teaches `AppConfig` this application's `Locale` and `Messages`. That block is why
  a key outside the catalog fails to compile instead of rendering as its own name. The
  hand-written `MESSAGE_KEYS` manifest that `MessageKey` is checked against lives in
  `tests/messages.test.ts`.
- `routing.ts` — `defineRouting`. `localePrefix` defaults to `"always"`, which is why
  `/ja` is the only shape a page is served under and `/` is a redirect.
- `request.ts` — the per-request config, loaded by exact path from `next.config.ts`, so
  it is a default export and `eslint.config.mjs` exempts it by name. It validates the
  requested locale rather than trusting it: the `[locale]` segment is catch-all, so
  `/favicon.ico` arrives here as the locale `favicon.ico`, and falling back to
  `DEFAULT_LOCALE` keeps that a rendered page the layout can 404 instead of a lookup
  into a catalog that does not exist. Its scoped
  `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-deprecated` for `requestLocale`
  deletes itself: `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` fails the lint the moment the
  deprecation lifts. Do not widen it to the file.
- `navigation.ts` — `Link`, `getPathname`, `redirect`, `usePathname`, `useRouter`.

**A message that renders as its own key name** means the catalogs and `MESSAGE_KEYS` are
out of step, or the string was read under a namespace that does not hold it. Run
`tests/messages.test.ts` first; it names the key.

## Never `next/link`

Take `Link`, `redirect`, `usePathname` and `useRouter` from `src/i18n/navigation.ts`,
and give them a pathname with no locale in it — `/`, not `/ja`. Reaching for `next/link`
or `next/navigation` directly is the mistake that module exists to prevent: it emits a
URL with no locale, `src/proxy.ts` then redirects it, and the reader pays a round trip
and loses the locale they were on.

Passing `locale` to `Link` explicitly is how a language switch targets another language;
leaving it off keeps the active one. A switcher across a tree of pages reads the current
path from `usePathname()` in the same module rather than hard-coding `/`.

**BACKGROUND:** `building-app-routes` for `src/proxy.ts`'s matcher and the `[locale]`
segment, which have to agree with each other.

## Adding a locale

This app ships `ja` only. A second locale is one list read four times: `LOCALES` in
`src/i18n/locales.ts`; a new `messages/<locale>.json` translating every key `ja.json`
holds; a static import and a `MESSAGES` entry in `src/i18n/messages.ts`; and a
`LocaleSwitcher.<locale>` entry in **every** catalog — that one is a new key, so
`MESSAGE_KEYS` in `tests/messages.test.ts` gains a line too. Nothing under `src/app/` or
in `src/proxy.ts` changes; neither names a locale.

Locale negotiation is `next-intl`'s middleware reading the request's `Accept-Language`
header and its locale cookie, and nothing more — no domain routing, no geolocation, no
stored per-user preference. Do not describe one that is not there.

**REQUIRED:** `starting-an-app` for _dropping_ a locale; that is a different list and it
owns it.

## What to run

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/messages.test.ts  # catalogs against each other and against MESSAGE_KEYS
pnpm typecheck                               # both type directions, and every t() call site
pnpm exec vitest run tests/proxy.test.ts     # only if routing or the matcher changed
pnpm build                                   # only if a page or layout changed
```

Then open `/ja` under `pnpm dev`. `pnpm run test:smoke` (after `pnpm build`) serves the
built application and checks that every shipped locale answers 200 with the matching
`<html lang>`, which catches a locale that never renders at all; nothing checks that a
string reads correctly in it, and that is what opening the pages is for.
