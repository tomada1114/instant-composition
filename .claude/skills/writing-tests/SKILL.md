  Use when writing or reviewing a test under tests/ — a .test.ts or a .test.tsx — or
  adding the regression test a src/ bug fix needs: naming an it() after behavior,
  driving a handler factory with new Request(), rendering a page under jsdom with
  NextIntlClientProvider, writing one contract suite shared by every implementation,
  asserting an error's class and `code`, not its message, sweeping edge cases with
  it.each, choosing a fake over a mock, replacing a real sleep with vi.useFakeTimers,
  isolating a filesystem test in mkdtempSync, or fixing a flaky or skipped test.

# Writing Tests

**Owns:** how one test case is written — its name, the interface it asserts through,
what it asserts, how it fakes the world, and the anti-patterns to reject in review.
**Does not own:** which file a test lives in, which vitest project it joins, and the
coverage floors (`placing-tests`); compile-time assertions with `expectTypeOf`
(`type-testing`); the shape of the error classes a test asserts against
(`designing-errors`); where the code under test belongs (`building-app-routes`).

## Naming and scope

- `describe`/`it` names state behavior, not implementation:
  `it("rejects a body that is not JSON", ...)`, not `it("calls parse")`.
- One behavior per `it`. Branching inside a test body belongs in a separate `it` or an
  `it.each` table, never an `if` in the test.
- Cover the happy path and the failure path of everything a zone publishes.

## Test through an interface, not around one

There is no single entry point to test this application through — each zone has its own
surface, and that surface is the seam:

- **A handler factory, driven with a real `Request`.** A handler factory under
  `src/server/handlers/` takes its dependencies as arguments, so a test builds a
  `new Request(url, { method: "POST", body })` and asserts the `Response` it gets back —
  status, `content-type`, and the parsed JSON body. Nothing is mocked: the dependency is
  injected because the factory asks for it. Assert what the handler passed a dependency
  through a recording wrapper rather than by counting calls.
- **A Route Handler module.** `src/app/api/<name>/route.ts` re-exports a handler
  composed elsewhere, so the only thing left to assert about the file itself is that
  identity — `expect(POST).toBe(builtHandler)`. Everything else is a test of the
  handler.
- **A component**, rendered under jsdom through Testing Library, with the context a
  Server Component tree would have supplied passed explicitly: `NextIntlClientProvider`
  with a `locale` and the real `messages/ja.json`, and `src/i18n/navigation` mocked for
  the router. `tests/home-screen.test.tsx` is the model: it builds the view the page
  would pass, and queries by role and accessible name rather than by class or test id.
  An asynchronous Server Component — every page under `src/app/` — is deliberately out
  of scope; no gate here renders one.
- **A contract suite.** When several implementations sit behind one interface, the
  behavior every implementation owes is written once as a `describe…Contract` function
  and called once per implementation with a harness that builds what each case needs. A
  new implementation adds a call, never a second copy of the assertions; a quirk of one
  implementation goes in its own `describe` beside it.

A zone is reached through what its `index.ts` publishes, never the module underneath it.
Enforced by: `eslint.config.mjs`'s `boundaries/private-trees-are-not-importable` block.
Wanting to reach past a surface to assert something means the module is the wrong shape,
not that the test needs an exception.

## Asserting errors

Assert the error class and its stable `code`, never the message text:

```ts
expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(SchemaMismatchError);
expect(error.code).toBe("ERR_SCHEMA_MISMATCH");
```

**BACKGROUND:** `designing-errors` explains why `message` is not a contract.

A function returning a `Result` reports an expected failure as a `Result`'s error branch
rather than by throwing, so assert on the returned value — `rejects.toThrow` on a call
that is supposed to resolve to a failure passes only when the contract is already
broken. Check that an error propagates through the whole call chain (an error code
reaching the HTTP status a caller sees), and that cleanup runs on the failure path too,
not only on success.

## Expected values come from outside the code

An expected value must come from an independent source — a known literal, a worked
example, the spec — never recomputed the way the implementation computes it.
`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)` passes by construction: it restates the implementation
and can never disagree with it, even when the implementation is wrong. Write the number,
string, or object you expect by hand, or take it from a source outside the function
under test. A message catalog read from disk is the same idea: `tests/messages.test.ts`
asserts against `messages/*.json` rather than against what a bundler resolved.

## Edge cases to sweep every time

`0`, `1`, negative, fractional where an integer is required, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`;
an absent optional property versus an explicit `undefined`; long, unicode, and emoji
strings; single-element and duplicate-element collections; cancellation and cleanup for
anything async. For anything parsing a request: a body that is not JSON at all, a JSON
array, a bare JSON string, a missing field, an empty string where one is required, and a
value outside the closed set the app ships.

Use `it.each([...])` for input/output variations, labelled through the `%s`/`%p`
placeholders in the title rather than a bare index. When the table is a mapping the
source states too, close it with `as const satisfies` so a new union member fails to
compile until the table covers it — `MESSAGE_KEYS` in `tests/messages.test.ts` is the
model.

## Fixtures and isolation

- Prefer factory functions (`function makeX(overrides = {})`) to shared mutable
  fixtures.
- `tests/fixtures/` is reserved for data under test, including deliberately malformed
  inputs that must remain byte-for-byte invalid. Fixture files are never imported as
  modules.
- Filesystem tests use a fresh `mkdtempSync(path.join(tmpdir(), "prefix-"))` removed in
  `afterEach` with `rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true })` — never write into a
  real project directory.
- Environment and global replacements go through `vi.stubEnv`/`vi.stubGlobal`, not
  direct mutation.
- `vitest.config.ts` already resets mocks and env/global stubs between tests, so an
  `afterEach` whose only body is `vi.restoreAllMocks()` is noise that hides the cleanup
  a test actually needs. Anything the runner does not know about — a timer, a listener,
  a temp directory, a child process, a rendered DOM tree — is still cleaned up
  explicitly, including after a failure. `tests/dom-setup.ts` is where the jsdom
  project's own `cleanup` is wired, once, rather than per file.

## Independence

Tests are independent: no shared mutable module state, no ordering dependency, no
dependence on timezone, locale, CPU count, or wall-clock time.

Nothing is left as `it.skip`/`it.todo` on `main`, and a flaky test is fixed rather than
retried. Enforced by: the `vitest/*` rules in `eslint.config.mjs`'s `tests/vitest-rules`
block, which covers `tests/**/*.ts` and `tests/**/*.tsx` alike.

## Fakes over mocks

Mock only at boundaries: network, filesystem, clock, child process, randomness. Never
mock the module under test or an internal collaborator — a test that mocks an internal
collaborator breaks on refactor while behavior is unchanged. Prefer a real in-memory
fake to a mock for anything beyond a one-shot call: a fake is a real implementation of
the interface, configured per case, so the code under test runs the same path it runs in
production. Assert on behavior and captured arguments rather than call counts, unless
the count itself is the contract.

Do not introduce an abstraction, or a fake for it, until something actually varies
across it.

## Fake timers

No real `setTimeout` or sleep: `vi.useFakeTimers()` plus
`await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(ms)`, restored with `vi.useRealTimers()` in a
`finally`. An abortable API is tested for the caller-visible effect of the abort _and_
for the timer and listener it removes, on both outcomes, including asserting
`vi.getTimerCount()` is back to zero after an abort.

## Anti-patterns

- Testing trivial property access while skipping business-logic edge cases.
- `toBeDefined()`/`not.toBeNull()` where a specific value is checkable.
- Testing that a dependency works, rather than how this application uses it.
- Mocking so much that the real code under test never runs.
- Pinning, in a test of one seam, a value another seam owns — a test of the composed
  route that asserted a fake dependency's wording would have to be edited to swap that
  dependency.

## Property-based testing

`fast-check` is worth reaching for when a function has a well-defined invariant over a
large input space — a round trip, an idempotent normalization, an ordering guarantee —
not as a default for ordinary tests. It is not a dependency of this repository today,
and adding it goes through the same review as any other dependency. **REQUIRED:**
`managing-dependencies`.
